= Code Valet Master

This repository contains the script and code necessary to build a Docker image
with a link:https://jenkins.io/[Jenkins] master and the necessary plugins for
it to operate.

This code was originally located in the
link:https://github.com/codevalet/codevalet[codevalet/codevalet] repository but
has since been moved out to allow for more independent iteration on the master
image itself.
